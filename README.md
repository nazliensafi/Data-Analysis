Course Objectives
Big Data and Data Analytics has permeated into every industry, government, and business
function. The future will need data-driven approaches for all  elds of human endeavour.
The challenges in handling massive datasets and performing the computations for analysis
to transition from raw data to information to knowledge and to application are many and
varied. Data analytics is at the core of interdisciplinary collaboration with the social sciences,
humanities, health and life sciences, ecology and the environment, culture and heritage, and
engineering.
The aim of this course is to introduce students to the Python programming language and
related tools for data analytics; and to expose them to a broad range of data analysis
problems across a range of disciplines.
